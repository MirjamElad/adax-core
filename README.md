# Adax
### The drastically simplified state management for the front end.
ADAX mini-library (less than 2K gzipped) is the first step in an effort to dramatically streamline apps' **developement** and **maintenance** by simplifying their logic flow.

It is usually very easy to implement and reason about a single web component life cycle.
Complexity rises when your app grows. Indeed, The more you code, the more it becomes harder to understand how everything fits together.

ADAX is committed to keeping your app as easy to maintain and reason about as it is with a simple web component!

ADAX is so simple there is hardly anything to learn.
No external dependencies, no complicated patterns to adopt nor boiler plate code to write.

You may even chose to only use plain old _JavaScript_ (or _TypeScript_) **from start to finish**.
ADAX only helps you adhere to simplicity!

ADAX does not force you to throw your old code. You can start using ADAX gradually in already existing apps (<sub><sup>either adopting ADAX completely or only partially</sup></sub>).

React | Vue | Angular | Svelte | Solid | Vanilla JS

Not only is ADAX designed to be used by any front end library/framework but it also facilitates using different libraries in the same app. ADAX allows all parts/libraries of your app to fully _access_ the same state and _react_ to its changes.

<sub><sup>(**NB**: _**adax-core**_ can be used with vanilla javascript or any library/framework. However, it is more convenient to use an adapter of your favorite library. For now we have _**adax-react**_, _**adax-vue**_ and _**adax-angular**_. More coming soon)</sup></sub>
